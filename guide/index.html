                  Preparing for an intercultural experience abroad can be exciting and overwhelming at the same time. This document contains a semi-structured guide, created with the purpose of offering resources to strengthen the preparation of students of the Modern Languages with Emphasis in English and French Degree Program of the Universidad del Cauca, that wish to attend a summer camp exchange in The United States, through the agency Camp Leaders, taking the experiences of students of the same program who have already participated in these exchanges as a reference. <br><br>
                  The participants' experiences were previously classified into three communicative competencies: sociolinguistic, pragmatic and linguistic. An analysis was then carried out, resulting in advice and recommendations for summer camp candidates.<br><br>
                  The guide is divided into specific themes to facilitate the understanding of the advice and recommendations. Each theme compiles suggestions given by students who have already had intercultural summer camp experiences. It is expected that this information will be used as a resource to prepare them for their future exchange experiences.

                  <b>1.</b> Research your camp before signing a contract. Choosing the right camp can make a big difference in your summer experience. Make sure to research and read reviews from other staff members before deciding on one. Additionally, it is important to ask the organizers about what a typical day is like at the camp, so you can prepare accordingly. 
                </p>
  
                <p class="mb-3">
                  <b>2.</b> Find out everything about the location of the camp and the weather you will be exposed to.
                </p>
  
                <p class="mb-3">
                  <b>3.</b> Make sure to bring appropriate clothing for your camp, for this, ask about the dress code of the camp and what clothes you need for the job you will be performing.

                <p class="mb-3">
                  <b>4.</b> Pack the necessary things in your luggage. It is very important and it is an advantage for you, because, besides saving money, it will help you to organize the space where you are going to live, avoiding possible moments of stress or small worries.

                </p>

                <p class="mb-3">
                  <b>5.</b> Do not be fooled by the idea that working at a camp is easy, as it can be quite exhausting, but keep motivation and good sense.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-3">
                  <b>6.</b> Keep an open mind. To have a successful experience at a summer camp, it is important to go in with an open mind and be prepared to work most of the time. Although you seek to learn and explore new cultures, keep in mind that work is the priority. It is necessary to be flexible and aware that the environment may present some challenges; thus, it is recommended to maintain a positive attitude towards the various situations.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-3">
                  <b>7.</b> Keep in mind that when going to a summer camp, the most important thing is to bring the essentials and not to worry about bringing too much clothing or unnecessary things. Since you will be working most of the time, clothes can easily get damaged and there is no need to bring the newest or most expensive ones. By being aware of this, you can enjoy the experience without unnecessary worries.

                <p class="mb-3">
                  <b>1.</b> Learn the essential information about nonverbal communication in the culture you are going to visit. It is important to study this a bit, as you never know how others may perceive your gestures and signals, and you could also misinterpret theirs. Observe others and learn.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-3">
                  <b>2.</b> Practice a lot of English. It is important to train your oral comprehension, not only with an American accent, but also with British, Irish, Australian accent and more in order to understand quicker and improve your oral skills. Speaking with people around you in that language is very important to make noticeable progress in your oral production and comprehension. 
                </p>

                <p class="mb-3">
                  <b>3.</b> Be aware of proxemics and respect personal space. Proxemics refers to the spatial relationship between people. Our Colombian culture is much more affectionate than European or American culture, so it is quite prudent to maintain distance until close contact is allowed.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-3">
                  <b>4.</b> Respect the way others express themselves. Keep in mind that when visiting a community different from your own, you should approach with an empathetic and respectful attitude towards their culture and customs. It is necessary to observe and learn from them, as well as take into account their way of communicating, both verbally and nonverbally.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-3">
                  <b>5.</b> Study vocabulary related to the job you will be performing or associated with the things you may encounter at the camp, to make it easier to understand instructions or conversations with native speakers.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-3">
                  <b>6.</b> Ask your friends about their experiences in camps so that there can be feedback and you know what to expect before traveling.

                <p class="mb-6">
                  Know the camp rules very well. Participants highlight the following rules and advise you to keep them in mind in order to have a better coexistence and not to make any mistakes:
                </p>

                <p class="mb-3">
                  <b>1.</b> Do not consume alcohol at your camp. Many of your campmates will most likely drink alcohol, but that does not mean you also have to do it. Be cautious and avoid problems.
                </p>
  
                <p class="mb-3">
                  <b>2.</b> Be careful with romantic relationships. Make sure that romantic relationships are allowed at your camp, and keep in mind that if you engage in a romantic relationship, everything has to be consensual and the person you are involved with should be of legal age. During work hours, avoid public displays of affection.
                </p>
  
                <p class="mb-3">
                  <b>3.</b> Maintain boundaries. It is important to remember that as part of the staff, you should not be alone with minors and always follow the safety policies established by the camp organization. Also, be cautious with what you say in front of children and never share personal information with them to avoid putting your work at risk.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-3">
                  <b>4.</b> Find out about the dress code rules of your camp. Some camps do not allow short shorts or two-piece swimsuits, and they may require that all shoes be closed-toe. Remember that part of the success of your camp experience depends largely on respecting these established rules and norms.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-3">
                  <b>1.</b> Be prepared to also work with adult people  and follow camp rules. Regardless of the job you will perform at the camp, you will have coworkers who are typically over 18 years old; therefore, make sure to always maintain a good relationship and try to ensure that, to the best of your ability, there is an equitable distribution of the work to be done as a team, so you can have a healthy coexistence. 
                </p>

                <p class="mb-3">
                  <b>2.</b> Your coworkers and bosses are willing to teach you how to perform your duties and it is important that you show your willingness and desire to learn. The summer spirit includes kindness and companionship among workers and campers, so be patient and allow those around you to help you if it is the case; do not worry, the experience and aid of others will be enough to help you adapt to your job.

                  <b>3.</b> Learn how to drive. Most camps have golf carts to move around. No matter if your job is support staff or counselor, it is very likely that you will be asked to drive one of these. You do not need a driver's license, but it is recommended that you have one.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-3">
                  <b>4.</b> Be prepared to work hard. Working at a summer camp can be an enriching experience, but it can also be demanding and exhausting. Prepare to work hard all day, as most activities and responsibilities take place from early in the morning until late at night. Although it can be difficult, it is important to maintain a positive attitude and be willing to collaborate on all necessary tasks to keep the camp running smoothly.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-3">
                  <b>5.</b> Understand and follow instructions. If you work at a camp as part of the staff, it is important that you understand the instructions given by your superiors. Make sure to ask for clarification if something is not clear, as it is better to ask than to assume and then make a mistake. If necessary, take note of the instructions given and make sure to follow them carefully.
                </p>

Try to participate in as many activities as possible. At first, it may be a little scary, but gradually you will adapt to the environment and the people.

                  <b>2.</b> Take the initiative to propose integration outings to the people you share with because many of these cultures are not familiar with being invited to others' plans. With caution you can engage in conversations that enrich your knowledge of other cultures in various aspects such as celebrations and social relations.

                  Working at a summer camp has an economic remuneration, which in many cases described by participants, is a considerable sum that can serve as useful savings to be expend on traveling in the USA, or when returning to Colombia; that is why participants advise the following:

                <p class="mb-3">
                  <b>1.</b> If you wish to save money, summer camps can be an excellent opportunity to do it on accommodation and food, as these expenses are covered by the camp organization. This can allow you to use your saved money to travel and explore new cities and cultures after the camp.
                </p>
  
                <p class="mb-3">
                  <b>2.</b> Bring the necessary; this will avoid excess weight and you will save money by not having to pay for extra luggage on airlines. Additionally, you will not have to spend money to buy things that may be missing while at the camp.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-3">
                  <b>3.</b> Save money to pay for your taxes. As a worker in the USA you will have to pay federal taxes that are mandatory in most of the cases, but do not worry about losing money, because normally this money is refunded to you some time after you do your report to the government.

                <p class="mb-6">
                  Finally, summer camps are places that offer various recreational activities; here are some tips to encourage aspiring participants to enjoy the experience:
                </p>

                <!-- Image container -->
                <div class="w-full flex justify-center items-center">

                <p class="mb-3">
                  <b>1.</b> Try a new sport or game. At camp, you will only be there for a couple of months and work can cause stress; therefore, there is no better way to channel those emotions than by practicing a sport or participating in games and activities.
                </p>
  
                <p class="mb-3">
                  <b>2.</b> Learn English while making friends. Participating in a summer camp can be an excellent opportunity to improve your English and make friends from different parts of the world. In camps, you have the opportunity to learn a lot of English by being surrounded by native speakers and having to communicate in that language all day long. Additionally, you can make friends with people from different countries and cultures, which significantly expands your perspective and personal enrichment.
                </p>
  
                <p class="mb-3">
                  <b>3.</b> Enjoy your experience. It is important to remember that, despite the challenges that may arise in your camp; the most important thing is to enjoy the experience. Take advantage of every moment to meet new people, improve your language skills, and learn about a new culture. Remember that you are in a new and exciting place, then do not limit yourself and open your mind to the opportunities that arise. Enjoy the moments of rest and use free time to explore the surroundings; maintain a positive attitude, and do your best to fully benefit from this unique experience.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-3">
                  <b>4.</b> Sometimes it is necessary to take the initiative in order to break the ice and start conversations or activities that enlighten you about intercultural lessons.

                  Additional information to take into account based on the sociolinguistic, pragmatic and linguistic communicative competences  
                </h3>
  
                <p class="mb-6">
                  During the analysis of the participants' experiences, different intercultural issues or situations that caused conflict during their time at the camps were identified, then, they were related with the communicative competences performed during this research. By relating these situations to the texts cited in the project, a series of proposals are developed to strengthen the preparation process of future summer camp attendees; these proposals go a little further than just giving advice because they offer solution ideas to conflicts and explain the specific area to which each problem belongs. The proposals are the followings:
                </p>
  
                <p class="mb-3">
                  <b>1.</b> Many participants express the magnitude of the cultural shock they experienced during their stay at a camp and the emotional conflicts that it caused them. The recommendation in these cases is to be patient during the adaptation process, in which social and linguistic norms must be relearned to find comfort in communicating with others.
                </p>
  
                <p class="mb-3">
                  <b>2.</b> When problems arise due to cultural differences (customs, way of expressing oneself, etc.), try to always resolve those differences through dialogue, either by communicating them to the person with whom you have the conflict or to your superiors if there is no other option.
                </p>
  
                <p class="mb-3">
                  <b>3.</b> We found that participants had or witnessed problems related to the consumption of alcoholic beverages within the camps, knowing that the camp rules prohibit this, especially because they are in the company of minors under 21 years old, which is the minimum legal age to consume alcohol. The recommendation is to comply with the camp rules and the country's laws on the regulation of the consumption of this type of beverage.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-3">
                  <b>4.</b> It is important to recognize and accept the existence of linguistic and cultural barriers in communication. This acceptance helps to reduce anxiety and stress associated with intercultural communication, as it allows for a more realistic and tolerant understanding of cultural and linguistic differences.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-3">
                  <b>5.</b> In these intercultural environments, affectionate relationships sometimes arise between participants, as they must share the same spaces for a time and live together daily. In these cases, it is best to inquire if these types of relationships are allowed in the camp and to keep in mind that they can only be with adults. Also, the most important thing is that everything done within the affective bond must be consensual.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-3">
                  <b>6.</b> Participants' experiences illustrate the challenges of adapting to a new culture and language. However, they also demonstrate the resilience and adaptability of people who find alternative ways to communicate effectively despite the linguistic barriers they face. Therefore, as a recommendation in this regard, try to practice using the new information acquired rather than the previously known information as it can help improve understanding and expand vocabulary.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-3">
                  <b>7.</b> Effective interaction involves understanding the needs of the other person and adapting one's own behavior to achieve real communication. Participants in these camps must make an effort to understand people in their environment from different cultural backgrounds and be clear and specific when communicating, ensuring that their messages are understood correctly.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-3">
                  <b>8.</b> Nonverbal communication is a very important topic in learning foreign languages as people within the different cultures of the world do not communicate solely through the articulation of words, but also through gestures, signs, and paralinguistic sounds. It is recommended that future attendees of summer camps research a little about this form of communication in the country they are heading to.
                </p>

                <p class="mb-3">
                  <b>9.</b> In all interactions, it is important for people to be respectful and considerate of others. This includes respecting cultural, opinion, and perspective differences, as well as being aware of how their actions can affect others. Therefore, it is necessary to highlight the importance of these skills for a participant in these summer camps, knowing that they will be exposed to an intercultural scenario.

                  My day started at 6:30 am; I woke up and went to take a shower. Then, I went to the dining room to have breakfast. The kitchen staff usually served pancakes or cereal. After that, I started my work and went to clean the buildings that I usually cleaned every day; those were 20 buildings. At 12:00 pm; I went back to the dining room to have my lunch. They normally served salad, vegetables, tuna, and a kind of meat that was weird. Something particular is that all food they consumed had to be Kosher, that is one meal prepared with special ingredients and only the Jewish ate it; i didn’t like it at all. After that, I came back to my work and finished cleaning all the rooms and supplied them with toilet paper, soap, face tissues etc… I ended my journey at 6:00 pm. and finally, I went to my room to rest. That was a normal day as a support staff member, more specifically a housekeeper.

                  Danae Basto -  I worked at Camp Walden in Diamond point New york.<br><br>

                  I was a nanny counselor, which means I took care of kids under the age necessary to be with the rest of the kids without special supervision. My day started at 7:30 am. I usually got dressed and ready before 7:50. At 7:55 am I picked up my kids from their moms and went to the dining hall with them to have breakfast. The food was really good and there was a great variety of things you could choose. There was a fruit and juices line, sauces lines, yogurt and other drinks, and finally the main line was to get pancakes or eggs or whatever the chef prepared that day. After that, I had to go to the freshman bunk which was the one for the younger girls at camp and get the kids ready for the journey. The first activity every day was at the waterfront. The kids could choose between going to the swimming pool or the lake; I had to go with them everywhere. After that, back to the bunks to change, then, we went to practice sport activities like soccer, baseball, gymnastics among others. Later, we went to the dining hall at 12:00 pm. to have lunch; then we had a rest hour, so the kids could rest inside the bunks and be silent for one hour. After that we had snack time, it was always ice cream. Later, we had arts and hobbies where the kids could do artistic activities, and finally, we had dinner time at the dining hall again at 6:00pm. The kids sometimes had presentations at nights, like dancing or circus or just games, so I usually dropped them in the auditorium to their moms and finally went to rest in my bunk.
